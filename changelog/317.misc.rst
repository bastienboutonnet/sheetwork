We now use ``pydantic`` to perform credential yaml validation. It was introduced in #314 for the Postgres adaptor and added to the Snowflake adaptor in this PR. This allows us to considerably reduce some manually implemented validation boiler-plate. We will progressively migrate all yaml/config files to being validated by ``pydantic`` down the road with no direct impact on end-users but a fair amount of joy for developers of the project.
