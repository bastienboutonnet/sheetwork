sheetwork 1.0.0 (2020-10-11)
============================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Columns that are now mentioned in the sheet.yml are first checked for presence in the sheet and ignored or skipped if not present with warning. (#150)
- Schema specification hierarchy is fixed: Flags > Config > Project. (#155)
- Pandas dataframe casting is disabled due to issues with mixed ints and strings (see #205, #204) (#206)
- Attempts to reintroduce datatype casting to solve issue with dates converion (see #216 for issue). Since the mixed str and ints issue is not solved on pandas side, int conversion doesn't actually happen (for now Snowflake deals with it ok and converts to the reguested int format). (#221)


Features
--------

- Raises errors when a sheet contains duplicate columns (#151)
- Interactive cleanup is a bit more intereactive (#156)
- Adds `InitTask` to `sheetwork` to ease users set their projects up. (#169)
- Sheetwork now checks for available updates on start (provided you have an internet connection) (#195)


Under The Hood/Misc
-------------------

- Logging to file always debug, logging messages in CLI look more like pretty prints. (#154)
- Simplify `SheetBag` internals
  - `check_table` is moved to the db adapter (#161)
- Fixes broken interactive flow of asking whether to push to db. (#163)
- CLI logging/progress messages are now timed (#171)
- Sheetwork now uses an adaptor/plugin design to allow and facilitate extensions of the tool to other databases. (#173)
- CLI arguments are now POSIX (#193)
- An proper sheetwork error is thrown when you do not provide a command to `sheetwork` in CLI (#207)
- Profile error messages are now a bit more helpful and more nicely formatted (#208)
- Use and try to fix most warnings from Pylance in an attempt to have more strict typing (#210)
- Poetry is now used a the package and dependencies manager (#215)
- When passing `--log-level debug` in CLI the format of the console output looks more like proper logs instead of the pretty prints to make following logs more easy (#218)

## 0.2.1 Daft Punk (2019/12/10)

Documentation Missed and was not usable.

## 0.0.0 Kraftwerk (2019/11/06)

### Overview

This is the very first version of sheetwork. It is named after the German electronic pioneers **"Kraftwerk"** as it is the pioneer (first version) of the package that will set and pave the way for future generations to come and we will all live happy forever ever after...

It loads Google Sheets into Snowflake, from the comand line and avoids the fast multiplication of `<insert_non_creative_name>_sheet_importer.py` type scripts.

### Features

- Loads google sheet into a pandas DataFrame. [#9](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/sheetwork/pull/9)
- Performs basic cleaning.[#10](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/sheetwork/pull/10)
- Pushes data to Snowflake using [data_tools.push_pandas_to_snowflake()](https://github.com/tripactions/data_tooling/blob/master/data_tools/db/pandas.py#L230). [#9](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/sheetwork/pull/9)
- `--dry_run` functionality skips pushes to database and offers preview of datatypes, and head of dataframe that would be uploaded to database. [#12](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/sheetwork/pull/12)
- `--mode dev` overrides target schema to "sand" to avoid pushing the wrong data to a production table or to allow for full flow testing while behind user permissions.[#11](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/sheetwork/pull/12)
- `--force` can be added when running in `dev` mode to force a push to otherwise overidden target schema (see bullet above). [#12](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/sheetwork/pull/12)

## 0.1.0 Jean-Michel Jarre (2019/11/04)

### Overview

This release focuses on making `sheetwork` a lot more flexible and robust. The main addition lies with the ability to read from a config file columns which data types need to be changed in table creation when pushed to database.

### Features

- Is able to read configuratio info from a configuration file (`sheets.yml`) which contains (amongst other things) column typing often required after pulling a sheet from google as the data loaded by pandas is often interpreted as strings. [#20](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/sheetwork/pull/20)
- Allows for interactive CLI interface on whether to run default cleanups when passing `--i`. This cleanup was previously applied to all sheets by default. [#17](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/sheetwork/pull/17)
- Under the hood: validates the config file in a pretty strict way for missing tags which are required when reading from config or for unalowable tags which could potentially break things down the line. [#24](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/sheetwork/pull/24)
