# sheetwork 💩🤦

A handy package to load Google Sheets to your database right from the CLI and with easy configuration via YAML files.

> ⚠️ **warning** `sheetwork` is still in its early inception (don't get fooled by the 1 in the version). Please do some testing before you end up using it in production, and feel free to report bugs.

> **compatibility**:
> - Python >=3.7, Mac OSX >10.14.
> - Probably works on most UNIX systems but not nested. Most likely absolutely not working in Windows.

🙋🏻‍♂️ **Want to use `sheetwork` on other databases? Let's talk!** ([Make an issue](https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/sheetwork/issues/new/choose), or ping me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5GnNNb))
