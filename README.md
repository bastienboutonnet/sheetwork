# sheetload ðŸ’©ðŸ¤¦
A handy package to load Google Sheets to Snowflake

Loads Google sheets from Data Team shared drive and uploads them to Snowflake.
Performs some cleanups on column names and string (such as removing trailing spaces etc.)

## Installation
1. Activate your virtual environment if you have one.
2. Sheetload requires funtionality from [`data_tools`](https://github.com/tripactions/data_tooling) but is currently not able to require and install the package as part of its setup since `data_tools` is not hosted on a pypy server. If you do not have `data_tools` installed. Head over to this [README](https://github.com/tripactions/data_tooling/blob/master/README.md) for installation guidance.
3. Make sure your access tokens and usernames are installed according to TripActions Data Tooling standards in the form of a `data_tools.ini` file. Setup information can be found in [data_tools Credentials](https://github.com/tripactions/data_tooling/blob/master/README.md#credentials).

4. Install Sheetload
```bash
pip install git@github.com:bastienboutonnet/sheetload.git@v1.1.0a1
```
Make sure you've setup your GitHub ssh keys, if you don't know how to do it, check [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/).

5. Check your installation:
```bash
sheetload --version
```
Should display something like this:
```bash
âžœ sheetload --version
sheetload 1.1.0a1
```
